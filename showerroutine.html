          Kourtney Kardashians skin care expert Christie Kidd, explains how rinsing out your conditioner and body wash at the same time could cause acne, especially on your back. ‘Rinsing out your conditioner at the same time as your body wash can leave an oily residue on your face and back. Although the residue is great for leaving your hair soft and silky smooth, it's not the safest for the skin and causes breakouts and clogged pores when it sinks into the skin.’ To avoid this, Kidd recommends washing out conditioner thoroughly and putting your hair up before you lather on body wash. That way, the body wash cleanses your back before the conditioner's oil can do any serious damage.

          According to Rhea Grous, Director of Aesthetics at Union Square Laser Dermatology, Hot water strips the skin of its natural oils and healthy bacteria, which plays a major role in keeping moisture in—and the bad stuff out. Because dryness triggers the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, hot water can worsen preexisting acne or cause a breakout.” “As in most things in life, moderation is key when it comes to showering” Grous says. “Stick with lukewarm showers that don’t last longer than 5-10 minutes, and make sure to moisturise your skin all over after you get out.”
